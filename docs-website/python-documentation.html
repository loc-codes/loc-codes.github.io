          Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for developing applications in various fields such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Scientific Computing</li>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
          </ul> 
          Python was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since then become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is designed to be easy to read and write, with a clean syntax and intuitive object-oriented approach. It has a vast standard library that provides many useful modules and functions for various tasks such as file I/O, networking, regular expressions, and more. Additionally, Python has a large community of developers who have created many third-party packages that extend its capabilities even further.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello,_world!">
        <header><h2>Hello, world!</h2></header>
        <p>Printing "Hello, World!" is often the first program that developers learn to write in a new programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
          To print "Hello, World!" in Python, you can use the built-in print() function. This function takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of how to use the print() function to print "Hello, World!" in Python:
        </p>
      <code>print("Hello, world!")
</code>
      <p>
        When you run this program in IDLE, you will see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the console.
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> print('Hello, world!')
        <br>... Hello, world!
      </code>
<p>Congratulations! You have just written your first Python program!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header><h2>Variables</h2></header>
        <p>
          In programming, variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program. In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them using the assignment operator =.
          </p>
          <p>
Here is an example of how to create a variable and assign it a value in Python:
          </p>
          <code>
          message = "Hello, World!"
          </code>
          <p>
            In this case, we are creating a variable called message and assigning it the value "Hello, World!".
          </p>
          <p>
            Python variables can hold many different types of data. You do not need to declare the type of a variable in Python. Python automatically works this out!
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables in Python can also be reassigned with a new value at any time. For example:
          </p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 5
            <br>>>> print(x)  
            <br>... 5
            <br><br>>>> x = "Hello"
            <br>>>> print(x)
            <br>... Hello
          </code>
          <p>In this example, we first assign the integer value 5 to the variable x, and then we reassign it with the string "Hello".

          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to storing data, variables can also be used in expressions and calculations. For example:
            </p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 5
            <br>>>> y = 3 
            <br>>>> z = x + y
            <br>>>> print(z)
            <br>... 8
          </code>
          <p>In this case, we are creating two variables x and y, assigning them the values 5 and 3 respectively, and then creating a third variable z which is the sum of x and y.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Strings,_Integers_and_Floats">
        <header><h2>Strings, Integers and Floats</h2></header>
          <p>In Python, three of the most commonly used data types are:
            <ul>
              <li>Strings</li>
              <li>Integers</li>
              <li>Floats</li>
            </ul>
            Let's take a closer look at each of these types and how to work with them in Python.
</p>
          <p><h4>Strings</h4></p>
          <p>A string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes.</p> 
          <p>Here is an example of a string in Python:</p>
          <code>
            >>> name = "John"
          </code>
          <p>You can concatenate two or more strings using the + operator:</p>
          <code>
            >>> greeting = "Hello"
<br>>>> name = "John"
<br>>>> message = greeting + " " + name
<br><br>>>> print(message)
<br>... Hello John
          </code>
          <p><h4>Integers</h4></p>
          <p> An integer is a whole number, either positive or negative. You can perform operations on integers using the standard mathematical operators such as +, -, *, and /. </p>
          <p>Recall the example from the last section:</p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 5
            <br>>>> y = 3 
            <br>>>> z = x + y
            <br>>>> print(z)
            <br>... 8
          </code>
          <p><h4>Floats</h4></p> 
          <p>A float is a number with a decimal point. You can perform operations on floats in the same way as integers.</p>
          <p>Here is an example:</p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 3.14
            <br>>>> y = 2.0 
            <br>>>> z = x * y
            <br>>>> print(z)
            <br>... 6.28
          </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Boolean_Logic">
        <header><h2>Boolean Logic</h2></header>
          <p>Boolean logic is a fundamental concept in programming that deals with true/false values. In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False </p>
          <p>You can create Boolean expressions using comparison operators such as ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=. </p>
          <p>Here are some examples:</p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 5
            <br>>>> y = 3
            <br><br>>>> print(x > y)
            <br>... True
            <br><br>>>> print(x = y)
            <br>... False
          </code>
          <p>Boolean expressions can also be combined using logical operators such as "and", "or", and "not". </p>
          <p>Here are some examples:</p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 5
            <br>>>> y = 3
            <br>>>> z = 7 
            <br><br>>>> print(x > y and x < z)
            <br>... True
            <br><br>>>> print(x < y or x < z)
            <br>... True
            <br><br>>>> print(not x > y)
            <br>... False
          </code>
          <p>In this case, we are using the and, or, and not operators to create more complex Boolean expressions.<br></p>
